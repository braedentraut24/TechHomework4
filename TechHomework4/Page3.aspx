        <p>Ya know, I've been working like 12 hours a day these past few weeks because Server Side is brutally hard and time consuming, and now I'm getting projects like this to do.  I'm already using bootstrap in server side, I'm not 100% sure why I'm even doing this.  It's really wasting my time.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Also, Bootstrap is extremely unintuitive.  How is there not a better way to style websites? It's 2021.</p>
